 The main objective of this project is to manage inventory for the timely fulfillment of orders, replenishment of the stocks to attain higher customer satisfaction and profits. This is achieved by setting up the SQL database as well as providing analytics for strategic decision making.

 ### Technologies Used
 
 ●	SQL Server Management Studio
 
 ●	Tableau

 ### Data Source

In this hypothetical scenario, The data files are expected to be shared with us at AURA cosmetics Business Intelligence team by our third party data vendors in excel format. This data exchange should happen daily except for weekends and public holidays. It is expected that the order of columns in the shared file should be the same as the order of columns in the table. 

The following files are expected to be shared with us daily -

    ●	Customer
    
    ●	Inventory
    
    ●	Order
    
    ●	Invoice
    
    ●	Contain
  
    ●	Product

The following tables are generated using data from the above tables -
 
    ●	Between
    
    ●	Within
    
    ●	TimeSeed
    
    ●	TimePeriod

*Kindly note that for the scope of this project the sample or mockup data/ files have been generated using Mockaroo (https://mockaroo.com/)
